Name:

   Beaglebone Mini Distribution

About:

   A GNU/Linux distribution for the Beaglebone (Black)

Main features:

   * Arm Cortex A8 optimized
   * Glibc based toolchain
   * Systemd init system
   * GNU/Linux system utilities (no busybox)
   * Ethernet support
   * OpenSSH client/server

Main builds:

   fs      - Filesystem
   linux   - Linux kernel
   u-boot  - Bootloader

Quick build guide:

   buildgear build fs
   buildgear build u-boot

Build system requirements:

   Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 Minimal (64-bit x86) with the following additional
   packages installed:

   $ sudo apt-get install unzip mtd-utils groff bison flex gperf texinfo \
                          libtool automake libncurses5-dev gawk libexpat1-dev \
                          gettext u-boot-tools libglib2.0-dev intltool docbook-xsl \
                          fakeroot 


   Also requires reconfiguring "/bin/sh" to use bash:

   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

   Fact: many software distributions fail to build using the dash shell.

Known issues:

   - Kernel cannot be compiled in Thumb2 mode. This is a bug in binutils 2.22

Filesystem layout:

   /usr/bin/            User binaries
   /usr/sbin/           System binaries (daemons, system utilities, etc.)
   /usr/lib/            Libraries
   /usr/lib/<prog>/     Program specific libraries (plug-ins, addons, etc.)
   /usr/include/        Header files
   /usr/share/man/      Man pages
   /usr/share/<prog>/   Program data files shared across all architectures
   /usr/etc/<prog>/     Configuration files for user programs
   /etc/                Configuration files for system programs

   The filesystem directory hierachy is arranged according to the FHS 2.3
   standard with the exceptions that /bin and /sbin are unused. Instead all
   software make use of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. For backwards compatibility
   /bin and /sbin remain links to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin respectively.
